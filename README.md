# LDA on Covid Open Research Dataset

Coronavirus has been a disease that has impact the world like no other virus has done in modern times, creating a worlwide emergencysituation.  This  work  aims  to  help  the  classification  of  information  by obtaining the topic papers are talking about as well as classify this topics in principal domains like vacciones and therapeutics this done possible using tools like Latent Dirichlet Allocation and dictionaries with terms that can help to improve information detection.
